Sample -- 1-6 is in the hat, 2 is the number of draws from the hat
```{r}
sample(1:6, 2)
```
To model a die or coin, you want to set replace=T so that rolls are independent of one another
```{r}
sample(1:6, replace=T)
```

```{r}
# probability of get 10 heads out of 10 tosses of a fair coin? 
dbinom(10, 10, 0.5)
# Biased coin produces head 70% of the time. One tosses the coin twice.
# What is the probability that both tosses have the same outcome?
dbinom(2,2,0.7) + dbinom(2,2,0.3)
```

```{r}
dbinom(2,2,0.3)

dbinom(2,2,0.5)


(0.5*0.09) / (0.5*0.09 + (0.5*0.25))

0.3*.3
```
